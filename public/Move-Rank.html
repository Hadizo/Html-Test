<H3> 1. Movie: District 13 (2004) + District Ultimate (2009) </H3>

<p>  One of the best street fighting movies about gangs battling for drugs and how the state deals with them. 
It also features plenty of action, including parkour, which gives the film a very distinctive character. </p>

<H3> 4 Blocks </H3>

<p> It's a German series about a large Arab family that lives off drugs and illegal activities, 
but without directly confronting the state, which eventually exposes and fights this family. </p>
